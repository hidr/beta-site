So, it’s been a while since we made a blog post, but now the torch has been passed to me! Quick Intro: My name’s Josh, and I’m the Support Advisor here at Hystreet. Essentially, my job is to find out what’s bugging -subtle pun- our clients and figure out how we make things better for them.

A big part of this role is working out what makes the top estate agents so successful and then relaying that back to our development team, who use that knowledge to make really good stuff. In my most recent research escapade, I spent some time talking to vendors in the local area to see what drew them to their agency. Overwhelmingly, it boiled down to their gut feeling when they first met their agent.
At the end of the day, your fees are always going to be set competitively against the other agents in your area; It’s going to take more than a fair deal to make you stand out from your competitors and secure that instruction. Surprisingly, it doesn’t even seem to be the agent’s experience and knowledge of the local area that seals the deal. One of most powerful sales tool that you’ve got is the first impression you make when meeting clients.
Obviously, knowing your corner of the market is important for the job but, time and time again, vendors have told me that the biggest things they looked for in their agents were approachability, professionalism, and a real desire to help them throughout the selling process. I think this quote from an anonymous vendor sums this idea up nicely:

“I want it to feel like my agent is providing a service, not just making a sale.”

Now, let’s think about this from an online agency perspective. If you’re running your service straight off a website, it’s going to be harder to make that first impression. It’s easy to fall into the trap of setting up a bunch of third party tools that plug straight into your website and thinking that’s all you will need for an online service. You still need to make an impression on your clients as early as possible, so they know who is managing their sale and (most importantly) you’ve got their back right from the get-go.
To take a leaf from a certain purple-coloured-brick-based online agency, it’s important for your clients to know that even though they have signed up for an online service, they are still dealing with real, local property experts who are going to make sure that their sale runs a smoothly as possible.
How you show this to your clients is up to you. For a start, you might want to add something like a ‘meet the team’ page to your website. This will give your clients chance to read a bit more about who is coming value their property. Use this page to share your experience in estate agency to really hammer home that your vendors are in safe hands, and then throw in a bit of backstory for good measure. On a human level, Joe Bloggs the part-time estate agent and full-time Dad will be much more appealing to your vendors than Joe Slick in the electric-blue suit.
Let’s not forget the power of the almighty phone call! Offering an online service doesn’t mean you need to reject all traditional practices. It’s always a good idea to follow up your online valuation requests with a phone call where possible, just so your vendors get a chance to put a voice to your name.
You could even invite your online clients into your office for a chat and a brew. On top of being a solid strategy for building rapport, in-office meetings can often be a great opportunity for you to upsell your clients to your traditional service.
That’s about it from me; I hope this post has given you some food-for-thought. If you feel like discussing any of the above, please don’t hesitate in getting in touch.
Cheers.
PS: It’s coming home!
