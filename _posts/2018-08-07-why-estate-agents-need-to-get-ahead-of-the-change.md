Hi, I’m Jamie (Jay) Duffy – I’m the sales manager here at Hystreet! I’ve been at Hystreet now for about four months. In my previous life I was an estate agent for eight years and a branch manager for Countrywide, it’s safe to say that over those eight years I have witnessed a lot of ups and downs; not just in my branch or more widely in Countrywide, but in the industry in general. Most recently the decline in dominance of some national companies, and the rise of online agents.

Upon seeing this change in the industry, I wanted to make a difference and allow fellow high street agents to compete with online agents – my position at Hystreet allows me to do exactly that. It’s great to be able to help high street agents use our platform to succeed and thrive in this changing market and really make a difference.

When talking to estate agents throughout the country, many of their concerns and worries really resonate with me – as I often thought about the same things when sat in my own branch! I appreciate I have a rather unique viewpoint in our industry, so in this blog I want to shine some light on some of the current movements in the industry from the point of view of someone who’s been on the ‘front-line’ is and now helping agents to make the right decisions for their business.

Countrywide’s current troubles are no secret now – and for me and many others who have been or currently are part of the organisation, they come as no surprise. Don’t get me wrong, there are many benefits of being an agent with Countrywide, including being part of a nationally established & recognised brand and the support that comes with being part of the larger business – but there’s also negatives. For me, some of my biggest frustrations were the lack of communications from upper management about the direction/focus of the business, and the inability to be able to make decisions for our own branches – more specifically around the subject of online services.

My branch was in an area of the West Midlands very close to PurpleBricks HQ, and the presence of online/hybrid agents was increasing every month – beyond a lot of people’s expectations. From my point of view as someone who works long hours, it’s clear to see why someone may opt for an online agent as the online convenience can be a massive benefit, enabling busy parents like me to check in on their sale/purchase when they finally get chance to relax at 8 or 9 o’clock at night! For others, the generally cheaper fees may be their biggest reason. However, despite these benefits, I think the growth of online agents may slow down over the next three to five years, and this has very little to do with the quality of their service…

When you look behind the scenes at some of the business models of these online agents, it takes a lot of work to build up one of these companies to the point where they are easily generating profit themselves. PurpleBricks, for instance, has only recently started to report a profit (and even that is debatable… although that’s a conversation for another time…) to put it simply, save for the current big players (PB, Emoov/Tepilo, Yopa, etc) many other online/hybrid agents simply aren’t sustainable, and investors will want to put their money on those which have proven themselves in the market, which is why many smaller onliners are opting for franchise/partnership models with traditional agents.

So, this may sound like all good news – online agents are unsustainable, and their growth is going to slow. Unfortunately, many higher-ups at Countrywide also thought the same thing. Now customers are aware that online services are an option, they will be looking elsewhere for these services, which could be a risk or an opportunity to independent agents, depending how you want to move forward…

Eighty per cent of estate agents in the UK are independently owned – which usually means they pride themselves on genuine local knowledge, and providing a unique, high quality service to their customers. Unfortunately, rising overhead costs such as the cost of owning/renting a high street shop front mean it is getting harder and harder to compete on price alone. However, as I mentioned before, there are still customers seeking out that cheaper service. Personally, I think this leaves agents with three options:

<h2>Cut commission for traditional service, or provide a traditional service for a low, upfront fixed fee</h2>

From the agents I’ve spoke to, this has been the first response to the growth of online agents from many independent agents throughout the country. Unfortunately, I also believe this to be the riskiest.

By lowering your costs you’re eating into your profit whilst aiming to provide the same levels of service, which leaves you with less money to pay wages, rent, etc. ultimately it can very quickly turn into a vicious circle that would break my heart to see smaller, independent agents get trapped in.

<h2>Outsource your services</h2>

It’s no coincidence that outsourcing providers for estate agents have been ramping up their advertising recently – outsourcing aftersales, viewings, photography etc is an easy way to bring down costs without seemingly compromising on service and seems like an easy route to many agents. Unfortunately, by outsourcing these services you’re getting rid of some of the things people love most about traditional estate agents such as the local knowledge, speaking to the same people, and being able to come into the office. Not only that, but you lose control over key parts of your service, lose opportunities to build rapport with clients and generate new business. Ultimately, if every estate agent outsourced their services, there would be nothing to separate any of these agents apart from one another!

<h2>Offer an online service</h2>

It probably comes as no surprise to you that this is my favoured option! Even before I came over to Hystreet, this was something I wanted to implement in my own branch for a couple of reasons. First, it keeps me in full control of my services, without carting customers off to another company. Secondly, by using Hystreet I’m still strengthening my own brand, not the brand of a national franchise. Third, and perhaps most importantly, I can provide a service that competes with online agents on price, service, and convenience without compromising on the service I provide to my traditional, full-service customers. It’s ultimately the easiest possible way to provide the best of both worlds.

If there’s one message I want agents reading this to be able to take away, it’s that the current market is full of opportunities for a savvy estate agent – provided you know where to look. If agents across the country were to start offering their own online/hybrid service today, it stops smaller online agents from gaining a foothold, helps traditional agents regain full control of their businesses, buyers & sellers will receive a much more tailored, personal service, and independent agents will secure their future and protect their business in an ever-changing market.
