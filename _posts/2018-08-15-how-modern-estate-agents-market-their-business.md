Hi! I’m Ellie, the customer success manager here at Hystreet. It’s my job to make sure our clients are receiving the best support possible when using their platform and provide them with as much user training as possible. One thing we aren’t keen on doing here at Hystreet is leaving our clients to guess how to use the system after watching a demo, not fully understanding how all the functions really work. We want our clients to feel confident when using Hystreet and equally as confident about the online service they’re offering.

After speaking with many estate agents, throughout their journey of offering an online service, I’ve found that agents are unsure about how to market and promote this type of service. To me, the solution to this seems simple! If you’re offering an online service, you’re target audience will be those that are online…
When using a service, we all want something that is seamless, accessible, consistent and trustworthy. This is the same with estate agency. Businesses have all had to adapt to the modernisation of technology and how it’s going to fit in with their product or service. By building your online presence, potential clients will be more reassured of your strength as a business and quality of service. Requesting feedback from clients and growing a positive reputation is vital to increasing the online interest your business will receive.
 We all know that there are individuals out there that aren’t the most “tech-savvy” but they have social media accounts and buy products online; proving such a wide variety of types of clients that you can appeal to using marketing techniques tailored towards potential buyers.
I am a huge fan of traditional marketing such as leaflet dropping, newspaper/shop ads, ‘sold on your street’ leaflets, et cetera, and believe these to be effective ways of promoting your business and are most definitely recommended methods. However, by using modern methods of marketing and thinking slightly outside the box, you will be in a much better position to compete with the online market and other agents that are already using these types of advertising. The aim of your business is to have an instantly recognisable brand that is trusted, and by putting some time into online resources, this is a far more likely achievement.

Social media has become a huge area for marketing and advertising, over recent years. With people simply searching through social media pages, looking for a service/product locally has never been easier. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are all extremely popular for advertising business. By advertising your brand and the services that you offer on these sites, you will become more recognisable, modern and accessible. Whilst this is a fantastic way to appeal to a larger audience, driving traffic towards your social media page/s and website is where it can get difficult.  

Engaging with the right people and other social media pages is going to be key to attracting attention to your business page. For example, if there were a local event taking place such as a summer fair and you had a property on the market, why not write a post advertising an open house taking place on the morning of the event and add a hashtag (#summerfair) to this to drive interest to the post. It’s important to gain support through-out your local community and have a good rapport with locals. These are the people who are most likely to require your services and recommend you to friends and family in the area, so they really are important!

I am a huge believer in locals supporting each other’s businesses. By following local businesses on social media and showing them support by sharing/liking posts, particularly if their business relates to your industry (e.g. a mortgage advisor) you will receive support in return. It can be extremely powerful to gain local backing, especially within the estate agency industry as, as mentioned previously, this will be where you will receive most of your custom. By doing this you will also increase the apparent interest of your business page on social media.
Another factor to take into consideration when looking to attract interest to your business through social media, is the time of day in which you are posting. People tend to visit their social media pages at certain times through-out the day. You may notice a correlation between the times in which you post to the amount of likes and shares you are receiving on each post. It’s important to take note of this and to perhaps carry out some research to ensure you’re doing everything you can to target the interest of potential clients.

Finally, requesting feedback from your clients and sharing this with others is a highly effective method adding credibility to your business and thinking of innovative ideas to improve the service you offer. Not only can you find patterns in feedback, making it easier to shape your product, sales method and adapt to your clients, you are making it clear that you have the drive to find out what it is your clients want. By monitoring this feedback, it will be apparent how responsive and helpful you are.
