It’s probably a safe assumption that most estate agents in the UK in 2018 have their own way of doing things, even if you’re part of a national chain. The unique combination of your local area, your clientele, and your team mean that your branch or agency will always be slightly different than the estate agents a few doors down. Multiply this by the thousands of estate agents throughout the UK, and quickly we realise that there can be massive variation in how they operate.

So why do we all use the same systems? Why do we have to bend over backwards to manage our sales in the way our computer programme tells us to? It’s something I often asked myself, and a lot of my colleagues did in their time in estate agency, too. What impact does that really have to an estate agents bottom line? Is it worth putting the time and money in to improving, or is it a case of a bad workman blaming his tools? These are the kind of questions we often ask ourselves at Hystreet to grow our platform in a way that suits those who use it most – agents.

Admin is the dullest and often most time-consuming part of an agent’s day. Usually, we see it as something we can’t avoid. It’s a necessary evil that we cope with to keep our business running smoothly – and while that’s true, there are still ways we can speed this process up. For example, Hystreet automates ID checks and property fact finds, minimising a lot of your time and enables you to focus on other tasks. There are of course many other opportunities to constantly improve and refine your admin processes throughout the day, by using your CRM to its full functionality, you can run reports and minimise the time spent on other tasks throughout the day.

Often, we’re quite content to carry on using products simply because we’re used to how they work, and we’ve grown accustomed to their processes – after all, people say ‘if it aint broke don’t fix it’ for a reason. But do you know how your CRM system shapes up when directly compared to what else is out there? Does it offer the same level of functionality, does it work as fast, does it look and feel great to use? If your staff are spending most of their time using these systems, it’s important that you can get answers to all your questions.

Following on from my previous point – if your CRM works adequately now, will you still be able to use It in two or five years’ time? Is your CRM continuing to grow and develop at a rate that you feel comfortable will align with your business plans? It’s important to consider these as well, so you’re not left behind.
