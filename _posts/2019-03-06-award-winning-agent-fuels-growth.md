Joe Phillips is the Director of AP Morgan Estate Agents in Redditch, Bromsgrove, and Stourbridge. Based out of their Redditch branch he is also the lead valuer and lister for the area. Being an estate agent for over a decade, Joe has seen a lot of change in the industry but still values offering traditional, high-quality customer service to his customers – this approach has earned his team many. Following the closure of various corporate agents in Redditch and the rise in popularity of online agents such as Purple Bricks, Joe began using Hystreet simply as a way to get his foot through the door of more valuations to ensure AP Morgan didn’t lose their spot as the leading agent in Redditch.

“I’ll be honest, I wasn’t a believer in the online model. It took my business partner to convince be to give it a go, as I thought it would flop. I didn’t believe that people were looking for an online service in the area where I operated.
Our branches in other towns – particularly our <a href="https://www.apmorgan.co.uk/">estate agents in Stourbridge</a> – had seen great results, but there was also a much higher percentage of sellers going with online agents in those areas”

“After going out to a few market appraisals booked via Hystreet I began to realise that there was a lot of success to be had via the online side of the business. The sellers booking me out via the online platform fell into three categories:
1.	Booked out an online-only agent and myself (side note: since offering the online service I have not lost a single instruction to an online agent)
2.	Wanted an online/upfront fee service but did not want to call out an online-only agent
3.	Is interested in our no-sale-no-fee service, but either wasn’t able to pick up the phone, or wanted to book the appointment at a time when our office wasn’t available.
Either way, any of the above are a bonus for me, and count as a valuation I previously wouldn’t have been called out to.”

“The team at Hystreet have not only provided me with the tools to offer these services, but the support team has helped me every step of the way to get someone who is as busy and hopeless with tech as myself up and running with the platform, helped to train my team, and worked with my web providers to make sure everything is set up on my website.”
