        Green and Co. are a large, independent estate agency founded in South Staffordshire, now with eight branches across their local area dealing with both lettings and sales.

      <p>
        “It's fantastic that we're able to offer an online service to our customers that allows us to maintain and improve the excellent level of service we've provided for over 25 years'. Along with our experience and extensive knowledge about the local area, we’re always looking at ways to continually improve our customer experience and their journey when selling or buying a property. With the platform, our customers are able to choose a service where they have complete transparency and are able to take more control. We’ve seen many customers that would prefer to go ahead with our fixed fee offering and it feels great knowing we’ve been able to support this type of service.”

      <h2>House Hub</h2>
      <p>
        House Hub was founded by an agent with 30 years of experience in the industry - formerly trading as a traditional agency complete with a high street office, they have only recently rebranded to House Hub and moved into an off-high-street ‘hub’ office, with great success. They now sell and let properties across South Birmingham and Worcestershire from their hub offices on the outskirts of Birmingham.
      </p>
      <p>
        “As an agent with 30 years’ experience in the industry, moving off the high street wasn’t something I’d considered. Seeing overheads increase, as many agents within the industry will have experienced, this was an idea that became progressively more appealing to me. Without the option of being able to offer an online service that allows me to cover the area’s local to me, it would have been extremely difficult to decision to make. I am however, now no longer on the high street and still able to provide a great service where I can meet and speak with clients whenever they need me. Sellers and buyers can book their appointment’s directly into my diary, meaning that I can spend more of my time doing what I do best!”

There are never enough working hours in the day, but that doesn't matter too much because our service is available to sellers at any time, anywhere in the world.

      <h2>Bowes Mitchell</h2>
      <p>
Bowes Mitchell are a family-run estate agency operating in and around Newcastle upon Tyne and Northumberland. With over 20 years of experience, they attribute their success to their drive to provide the very best customer service, the integrity of their team (all of which have been part of the company for at least 10 years) and their willingness to embrace ground-breaking technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hystreet has been a brilliant tool for bringing in new leads. The Availability system let consumers book valuations straight into our diary and when we go out to those valuations, we've got the perfect opportunity to sell our traditional service to the consumer. We even get a head start over other agents valuing the property because of all the property information that Hystreet gathers as part of the booking process.”

      </p>
      <p>
        “We've used Hystreet to take our Estate agency service online after being a traditional agency for over 70 years - now, we're reaching clients that would have gone straight to online providers like Purplebricks. Not only that, because the [Hystreet] platform automates so much of the selling process, we can still dedicate just as much time to our traditional service. Double the offering to clients without diluting the brand we've worked so hard to build!”
