    <h1>Chasing feedback</h1>
    <p>Hystreet chases feedback from customers automatically after viewings happen. After the appointment takes place, 24 hours after, and 48 hours after, making sure the potential buyer has ample opportunity to view, think, and respond with feedback and an offer that they think is suitable. Each time the platform chases the potential buyer, we also notify the seller to let them know that you are seeking feedback. If, after 72 hours, we haven’t received anything from the potential buyer, the platform will automatically let the seller know that you have chased a few times and heard nothing back, and usually when this happens it means that the potential buyer isn’t interested in moving forwards. Don’t worry – this doesn’t stop that potential buyer from coming back later! If they have been away and want to submit an offer in two weeks time, they will still be able to. When an offer is made, the agent managing the sale of that property and all the sellers are notified and can move forward with the sale. All the above happens without you having to do anything at all – how much time would that save you?
