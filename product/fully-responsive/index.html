      <h1>Fully responsive</h1>
      <p>Hystreet is designed from the ground-up to be fully responsive. If you've been speaking to a web developer or any other kind of techie, you may have heard this term bandied about quite a bit in reference to websites but maybe you're not too sure what it means? To put it simply, when a web page loads on any device (whether it's a website, like you're viewing now, or a web app like the Hystreet system) elements on the page such as menus, images, forms, text, etc, all shrink, grow, and shift around in order to make sure they're displayed correctly on any device.

        So, what does this mean for Hystreet? Essentially, this means that whatever device you use to view Hystreet on, it will display all the information you need in a way that makes sense, it loads quickly, and provides full functionality – allowing you full access whilst you’re on the move, whether that’s outside of work or whilst on appointments. By being able to access your CRM on a mobile device whilst at an appointment, you’re able to get instructions and payments right there and then on appointments. It also means that the system works perfectly for those who will be using a mobile device most the time – your customers.</p>
