      <h1>ID checks</h1>
      <p>Hystreet provides AML compliant, fully electronic ID checks. This effectively enables you to confirm clients details instantly without having to complete anything on your end â€“ all the customer has to do is input a few details and once the check is completed the system is automatically updated. Not only does this save you time compared to how long it takes to manually check ID, but it also makes it much more convenient, as it allows customers to submit these details at <a href="/product/24-7/">any time of day</a> or night, wherever they are, <a href="/product/fully-responsive/">on any device</a>.</p>

      <p>
      Many customers are surprised by just how quick and easy running ID checks with Hystreet is. Those of us with experience in branch as estate agents understand that ID checks are one of the most tedious parts of the property sale progress - as testament to this, many of our customers and other agents we speak to are using a wide range of third party tools to help make this smoother, however they are still reliant on getting information such as date of birth, address, etc, so the agent can manually enter this data. Hystreet saw a way to improve this process not just for agents, but for buyers and sellers as well.

        Hystreet's ID check system verifies the identities of individuals both in the UK and internationally in real time - this means you and your customers are provided with a fast, secure, and easy to use environment. The information can be entered by either the agent or the customer 24 hours a day, and as soon as it is submitted is then compared with over one billion records, allowing Hystreet to decide near-instantaniously whether or not the transaction is genuine. What's more, the speed of the check means that both you or your customer aren't left waiting, freeing you up to spend time on what's important.
