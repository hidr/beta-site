        With Hystreet, your customers can instruct and pay you easily over the web, along with any add-on services they need. With just a few clicks, vendors can instruct you at any time of day or night, so no longer do you have to spend hours chasing payments.

      <h2>
          Compliance made simple
        </h2>
      <p>
        Hystreet isn’t just an easy way to get instructions and publish properties – we streamline the entire process for you. Once an offer has been made on a property, Hystreet chases and allows buyers to submit all their proof of funds and solicitor’s details for your approval. Once your buyers and vendors have submitted everything you need, Hystreet will automatically generate a memorandum of sale for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chasing fact finds can be a complicated part of your sales process, but Hystreet makes it simple. Your vendors can submit all the information you require via your system, along with copies of any documentation or certification you may need. Your vendors can do this at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vendors and buyers are chased automatically to submit their ID to Hystreet. This automatically checks and approves their identity in just a couple of minutes, meaning you save time whilst still staying fully compliant.
