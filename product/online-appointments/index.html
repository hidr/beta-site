      <<h1>Book appointments online</h1>
      <p>Hystreet allows customers to book appointments online at <a href="/product/24-7/">any time of day</a> or night, including valuations and viewings. We recognise that there are other ‘online appointment booking’ services on the market as many of them were formerly used by current Hystreet customers. According to those customers, these systerms are effectively no more efficient than a phone call, requiring multiple requests and confirmations of when and where the appointment is taking place, and who is attending, which in some situations can actually take more time from the agent than if they just picked up the phone in the first place. We've taken what our customers have said about other products on board and we believe that Hystreet's active diary management is simply the best on the market.

<p>
         Unlike other products and services, Hystreet employs a unique ‘one-click’ confirmation technology that allows all the above to be confirmed with a single click from whoever is booking the appointment. As Hystreet uses active diary management, the platform will automatically check when all required parties are available for the appointment that needs to be carried out, so whether or not it’s just checking against one person’s diary for an initial valuation, or if multiple people and agents need to be present for an accompanied viewing, Hystreet is capable of managing it, booking it in everyone’s diaries, and notifying everyone it needs to – instantly.</p>
