      <h1>Provide an online service</h1>
      <p>
        It's no secret that online agents are taking more and more of the market, and agents throughout the country are becoming more and more frustrated with online-based one man bands misleading customers and taking more and more customers on the promise of a better, more efficient service. Traditional agents know as well as us that the majority of sellers who opt for an online-only agent are left with very little in terms of customer service from the valuer, or support from other members of the estate agent's team (if there are any) so, why do they continue to grow?</p>
        <p>
          As you can understand, we've done a lot of market research around this. We have found that despite the warnings, in today's modern day and age sellers simply can't ignore the convenience of a 24/7 online platform and all the tools and additonal communication it can provide. There's a better way for agents to offer an online service than simply to become an online-only agent. This was the realisation that concieved the initial idea for Hystreet. A platform that agents who truly care about high-level customer service can use to expand their  businesses.
        </p>
      <p>Hystreet can be used by your estate agency to provide a fully online service if you wish. Either alongside your traditional offering, or as part of an entirely new brand. With Hystreet, thereâ€™s technically no need to provide a high street office for your customers as they will have access to a <a href="/product/24-7">24/7 portal</a> to manage their sale and they can still contact you, their dedicated estate agent, if they need to.
  </p><p>
  You still retain full control over your service levels, even effectively giving your business two bites of the cherry by bringing someone onboard using Hystreet and then upselling them to a  full no-sale-no-fee service.
